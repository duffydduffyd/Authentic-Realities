#### Authentic Realities visualizes pay discrepancy data in a Virtual Reality environment. We take numbers on a spreadsheet and convert them to an experience that a user can see and feel.

#### We begin the project by using excel to model salary differences. After subtracting fixed costs and making assumptions around market returns, we project how much an individual accumulates over a lifetime. Authentic Realities is walk through time via a city street. Users get to experience major life events like getting job, buying a house, and retiring. You are compared to a colleague who does the same work, at the same job, for a higher salary as they experience the same life events. The outcomes from each of these characters are noticeably different.
